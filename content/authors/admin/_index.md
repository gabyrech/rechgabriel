With a background in Biology (Argentina), I've been working in Genomics and Bioinformatics since 2009, when I started my PhD Fellowship at the University of Salamanca (Spain). Since then, I've been fascinated about using information technologies for decoding the complexity of life. I've been working in the bioinformatics side of a wide variety of projects, such as investigating pathogenicity genes in pathogenic fungi and bacterias, exploring the use of miRNAs as biomarkers in cancer or exploring the functional role of transposable elements. All these projects have had required not only an effective data management and processing of the sequencing data, but also a comprehensive understanding of the state-of-the-art computational methods.

At JAX I work closely to Genome Technologies Team in developing and applying the most innovative bioinformatic methods for analyzing data generated with the cutting-edge genomic and sequencing technologies.
