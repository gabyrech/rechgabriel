With a background in Biology, I've been working in Genomics and Bioinformatics since 2009, when I started my PhD Fellowship at the University of Salamanca (Spain). Since then, I've been fascinated about using data science and informatics for decoding the complexity of life.

I've worked in a wide range of g

enomics questions such as determining the role of pathogenicity genes in pathogenic fungi and bacterias, exploring the use of miRNAs as biomarkers in cancer and how to use long-read sequencing technologies to better understand the role of transposable elements. 

In recent years, I have become very interested in transferring some of all we know about genomics into applications that directly benefit human health and well-being. This brought me to the Genome Technologies Group at the Jackson Laboratory, where I have been working on several exciting projects t﻿hat point in that direction, such as using methylation signatures in liquid biopsies, applying targeted long-read sequencing to characterize complex mutations, and performing quality controls of gene-therapy AAV and lentivirus vectors.
